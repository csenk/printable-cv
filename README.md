# Printable CV
The idea of this project is to utilize the capabilities of HTML5 and CSS3 to build an interesting layout for a CV that can be viewed in current browsers and even better: it can be printed for example into a borderless PDF.

## How to use
Clone the repository, execute `~> npm run watch` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080/.

## Deployment
Run `~> npm run build` and upload the `dist/` folder to your preferred webspace.

## Licensing
The license used is a derived MIT license with the following small customization:

```
The above copyright notice shall be visibly included in the final product.
```

Please feel free to contact me for custom licensing options if you want to remove the copyright notice for your CV.
